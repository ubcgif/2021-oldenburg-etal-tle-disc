	abstract = {Simulations and inversions of electromagnetic geophysical data are paramount for discerning meaningful information about the subsurface from these data. Depending on the nature of the source electromagnetic experiments may be classified as time-domain or frequency-domain. Multiple heterogeneous and sometimes anisotropic physical properties, including electrical conductivity and magnetic permeability, may need be considered in a simulation. Depending on what one wants to accomplish in an inversion, the parameters which one inverts for may be a voxel-based description of the earth or some parametric representation that must be mapped onto a simulation mesh. Each of these permutations of the electromagnetic problem has implications in a numerical implementation of the forward simulation as well as in the computation of the sensitivities, which are required when considering gradient-based inversions. This paper proposes a framework for organizing and implementing electromagnetic simulations and gradient-based inversions in a modular, extensible fashion. We take an object-oriented approach for defining and organizing each of the necessary elements in an electromagnetic simulation, including: the physical properties, sources, formulation of the discrete problem to be solved, the resulting fields and fluxes, and receivers used to sample to the electromagnetic responses. A corresponding implementation is provided as part of the open source simulation and parameter estimation project SIMPEG (http://simpeg.xyz). The application of the framework is demonstrated through two synthetic examples and one field example. The first example shows the application of the common framework for 1D time domain and frequency domain inversions. The second is a field example that demonstrates a 1D inversion of electromagnetic data collected over the Bookpurnong Irrigation District in Australia. The final example is a 3D example which shows how the modular implementation is used to compute the sensitivity for a parametric model where a transmitter is positioned inside a steel cased well.},

	abstract = {We propose a new framework for incorporating petrophysical and geological information into voxel-based geophysical inversion. By developing the geophysical inverse problem from a probabilistic perspective, we redesign the objective function and the iteration steps as a suite of cyclic optimization problems in which three separate MAP optimization problems are solved using geophysical, petrophysical and geological data, respectively. By quantitatively linking these data into a single framework, we recover a final inverted model that reproduces the observed, or desired, petrophysical and geological features while fitting the geophysical data. To achieve our goal we replace the Gaussian prior, used in the Tikhonov inversion approach, by a Gaussian mixture model. After each geophysical model update, the mixture parameters (means, variances and proportions) are determined by the geophysical model and the expected characteristics of the lithologies through another optimization process using the expectation–maximization algorithm. We then classify the model cells into rock units according to the petrophysical and geological information. These two additional steps over the petrophysical and geological data result in a dynamic update of the reference model and associated weights and guide the inversion towards reproducing the expected petrophysical and geological characteristics. The resulting geophysical objective function does not require extra terms to include the additional petrophysical and geological information; this is an important distinction between our work and previous frameworks that carry out joint geophysical and petrophysical data inversion.We highlight different capabilities of our methodology by inverting magnetotelluric and direct-current resistivity data in 1-D and 2-D, respectively. Finally, we apply our framework to inverting airborne frequency domain data, acquired in Australia, for the detection and characterization of saline contamination of freshwater.},

This is particularly true when working with data sets where it may not even be clear how to plot the data: 3D direct current resistivity and induced polarization surveys (it is not necessarily clear how to organize data into a pseudosection) or multicomponent data, such as electromagnetic data (we can measure three spatial components of electric and/or magnetic fields through time over a range of frequencies). Inversion is a tool for translating these data into a model we can interpret.

In the first stage we invert dc data to recover the background conductivity. In the second, we solve a linear inverse problem and invert all time channels simultaneously to recover the IP parameters. The IP decay curves are represented by a stretched exponential (SE) rather than the traditional Cole–Cole model, and we find that defining the parameters in terms of their logarithmic values is advantageous. To demonstrate the capability of our simultaneous SIP inversion we use synthetic data simulating a porphyrymineral deposit. The challenge is to image a mineral body that is hosted within an alteration halo having the same chargeability but a different time constant. For a 2-D problem,wewere able to distinguish the body using our simultaneous inversion but we were not successful in using a sequential (or conventional) SIP inversion approach. For the 3-D problem we recovered 3-D distributions of the SIP parameters and used those to construct a 3-D rock model having four rock units. Three chargeable units were distinguished. The compact mineralization zone, having a large time constant, was distinguished from the circular alteration halo that had a small time constant. Finally, to promote the use of the SIP technique, and to have further development of SIP inversion, all examples presented in this paper are available in our open source resources.},

	abstract = {To forecast rock glacier movements, it is necessary to have dependable information on their internal structures and physical properties. A first attempt to expand our knowledge of a rock glacier in the Swiss Alps involved acquiring ground-based ground-penetrating radar (GPR) data along numerous profiles using different acquisition systems and antennae with different nominal frequencies. Images derived from these ground-based data were inconsistent and unreliable. For our second attempt, we recorded GPR data using a helicopter-mounted system. The helicopter GPR sections were surprisingly good, with consistent images along adjacent and intersecting profiles. Internal shear horizons, ice-rich and ice-poor regions and the bedrock interface were well delineated on the helicopter GPR images. Besides providing excellent-quality images, the helicopter GPR system allowed areas of the rock glacier to be surveyed that would have been difficult or impossible to access for a ground-based study. Because near-surface heterogeneity does not seem to have a major effect on helicopter GPR data acquired across a rugged rock glacier, we suggest that helicopter GPR surveying might be useful for investigating many terrains covered by heterogeneous loose material, including debris avalanches, scree slopes and rockfalls.},

	abstract = {We discuss the use of helicopter-borne transient electromagnetic (HTEM) for a high-resolution spatial and vertical characterization of the near surface in a structure-controlled Wadi in central Saudi Arabia. In this area, seismic data quality is poor, and seismic imaging suffers from a combination of scattering effects-due to swarms of faults reaching the surface-and large velocity variations occurring along subvertical boundaries between the Wadi sediment infill and the surrounding carbonate plateaus. HTEM was selected from a suite of nonseismic methods for multiparameter velocity-model building to enhance the velocity estimation for the Wadi and surrounding areas. HTEM data were modeled by performing spatially constrained 1D resistivity inversion to obtain a high-resolution image of the near surface with sensitivity to a depth of 400-500 m from the surface. Sharp boundaries of the Wadi and fine vertical layering, obtained from the HTEM inversion, provide detailed information about the parameter variations in the near surface. A seismic-HTEM joint-inversion approach is developed using a cross-gradient structural operator to constrain the velocity inversion with the higher resolution HTEM data. Joint-inversion results provide sharp velocity reconstruction across the Wadi boundaries and increase the dynamic range of the velocity variations when compared to a single-domain tomographic approach in which the HTEM contribution is ignored. Superior imaging results in both time and depth are derived from velocities estimated by the seismic-TEM joint-inversion approach.},

	abstract = {The magnetotelluric (MT) method is important for exploration of geothermal systems. The information on the Earth's resistivity obtained with MT methods has been valuable in imaging the hydrothermal alteration of such systems. Given its ability to recover complex resistivity models for the Earth, three-dimensional (3D) MT inversion has become a common practice in geothermal exploration. However, 3D inversion is a time-consuming and complicated procedure that relies on computer algorithms to search for a model that can explain the measured data to a sufficient level. Furthermore, many elements of inversion require input from the practitioner, which can easily bias the results. Consequently, final 3D MT results depend on various factors, including the inversion code, the model mesh used to represent the Earth, data quality and processing, and constraints imposed during the inversion procedure.In this paper, to explore how this variability in 3D MT modeling impacts the final model, we invert MT data sets from the Krafla and Hengill geothermal areas in Iceland, using three different inversion codes. In each case, the modelers had the freedom to select a subset of the data and implement the inversion for the respective code in an optimized way. We compare the results from all the inversion codes, as well as consider the setup and assumptions made during the inversion process, all of which helps enhance the robustness and quality of the results. The comparison is done in multiple ways, using visual comparison of the recovered resistivity models, as well as comparing the structural similarities of the models by employing a structural correlation metric based on cross-gradients and other types of metrics for structural correlation. This approach highlights structures that are common in all three models, and implies that these structures are independent of the inversion code and necessary to fit the data.All modeling results from both Krafla and Hengill are consistent to first order, recovering a conductive layer on top of a resistive core typical of high temperature geothermal systems. For Hengill, the models show strong structural agreement, with all inversions recovering a moderately layered resistivity model but adding detail to previous work done in the area. Major differences are found in areas with coarse data coverage and hence questionable model resolution. Where the recovered structures in different models coincide, our confidence that these structures are well-constrained by the data is elevated, in spite of the different setup and assumptions in the codes these structures are required; so they can be interpreted in terms of geology with more certainty. Results from Krafla are not as consistent as results for Hengill, related in part to the Krafla data being nosier than the Hengill data. The models from Krafla have coinciding larger structures, but small-scale structures there are less coherent. One of the consistent structures in all the models is a conductive zone reaching from a depth of 5. km to shallower depths in the northern part of the area.},

	abstract = {Gas hydrates are a potential energy resource and hazard for drilling and infrastructure, yet estimates of global volume vary by over three orders of magnitude. Hydrates are electrically resistive compared to water saturated sediment and so electromagnetic methods provide an additional tool to seismic surveys and drilling for determining hydrate saturations. A marine electromagnetic survey was carried out at Hydrate Ridge, Oregon, USA, with the aim of testing the use of controlled source electromagnetic (CSEM) and magnetotelluric (MT) methods to map gas hydrate and free gas below the gas hydrate stability zone. A 2-D CSEM inversion supports the scenario deduced from previous seismic and drilling results, which indicate two mechanisms of hydrate emplacement: a transport-dominated and reaction-dominated regime. A prominent resistive region of 2.5-4 Ωm at a depth of about 130 mbsf, near the seismic bottom simulating reflector (BSR), suggests that 27 to 46 per cent of the bulk volume is filled with hydrate, depending on whether Archie's Law or the Hashin-Strikman bounds are used. This is representative of a reaction-dominated regime for hydrate emplacement, and where a significant low velocity zone exists based on a seismic tomography inversion, suggests large quantities of free gas below the BSR. Electrical resistivity logging while drilling (LWD) data show general agreement with the CSEM inversion model except for a CSEM-derived resistive region at seismic horizon A, known to transport free gas into the gas hydrate stability zone. Inversion of MT data collected simultaneously during the CSEM survey provides a complimentary low-resolution image of the shallow sediments and shows folding in the accretionary complex sediments similar to that imaged by a tomographic seismic velocity model. © 2011 The Authors Geophysical Journal International © 2011 RAS.},

The data were inverted using a laterally constrained 1D inversion considering the full decay curves to retrieve the four Cole-Cole parameters. For all profiles, the results reveal a highly chargeable unit that shows a very good agreement to the findings from 15 boreholes covering the area, where the extent of the waste deposits was measured. The thickness and depth of surface measurements were furthermore validated by el-log measurements giving in situ values, for which the Cole-Cole parameters were computed.

	abstract = {Magnetic susceptibility affects electromagnetic (EM) loop-loop observations in ways that cannot be replicated by conductive, nonsusceptible earth models. The most distinctive effects are negative in-phase values at low frequencies. Inverting data contaminated by susceptibility effects for conductivity alone can give misleading models: the observations strongly influenced by susceptibility will be underfit, and those less strongly influenced will be overfit to compensate, leading to artifacts in the model. Simultaneous inversion for both conductivity and susceptibility enables reliable conductivity models to be constructed and can give useful information about the distribution of susceptibility in the earth. Such information complements that obtained from the inversion of static magnetic data because EM measurements are insensitive to remanent magnetization. We present an algorithm that simultaneously inverts susceptibility-affected data for ID conductivity and susceptibility models. The solution is obtained by minimizing an objective function comprised of a sum-of-squares measure of data misfit and sum-of-squares measures of the amount of structure in the conductivity and susceptibility models. Positivity of the susceptibilities is enforced by including a logarithmic barrier term in the objective function. The trade-off parameter is automatically estimated using the generalized cross validation (GCV) criterion. This enables an appropriate fit to the observations to be achieved even if good noise estimates are not available. As well as synthetic examples. we show the results of inverting airborne data sets from Australia and Heath Steele Stratmat, New Brunswick.},

	abstract = {We present a method for inverting surface magnetic data to recover 3-D susceptibility models. To allow the maximum flexibility for the model to represent geologically realistic structures, we discretize the 3-D model region into a set of rectangular cells, each having a constant susceptibility. The number of cells is generally far greater than the number of the data available, and thus we solve an underdetermined problem. Solutions are obtained by minimizing a global objective function composed of the model objective function and data misfit. The algorithm can incorporate a priori information into the model objective function by using one or more appropriate weighting functions. The model for inversion can be either susceptibility or its logarithm. If susceptibility is chosen, a positivity constraint is imposed to reduce the nonuniqueness and to maintain physical realizability. Our algorithm assumes that there is no remanent magnetization and that the magnetic data are produced by induced magnetization only. All minimizations are carried out with a subspace approach where only a small number of search vectors is used at each iteration. This obviates the need to solve a large system of equations directly, and hence earth models with many cells can be solved on a deskside workstation. The algorithm is tested on synthetic examples and on a field data set.},

	abstract = {A principal goal for many humanitarian projects is to build capacity so that local stakeholders have the expertise to continue using technological solutions that have been introduced to them. Sustainability therefore requires that TOT's (Trainer of Trainers) be trained to understand and apply the new technology and that there are pathways for continued interaction after the project has formally been completed. In this talk we share our experience towards achieving this goal and we highlight the essential role that the open source ecosystem has played throughout the 3 stages of the project: (1) course instruction, (2) direct current (DC) resistivity field surveys, and (3) post-project sustainability. Open source refers to software, educational material and data that are made freely available under a license that allows others to reuse, adapt, and contribute to the development of the resources. These are further enhanced by adopting a philosophy of openness \& collaborative practices (e.g. working on shared documents, or using social media for communication). For our Geoscientists Without Borders (GWB) project we relied on: (a) web-based repository for slides and videos; (b) Jupyter notebooks and open source software for teaching concepts of DC resistivity and inverting data, (c) a public repository for data and processing to allow all results to be reproduced; (d) case history documents to allow multiple people to collaborate on the same project; (e) social media to promote the organization of the Myanmar Hydrogeophysics Society and communication therein, (g) video conferencing to connect with TOT's to maintain interaction. Without these resources our outcomes would have been severely marginalized. We hope that sharing our experience and resources will benefit humanitarian efforts being carried out in other regions.},

The forward model consists of Maxwell’s equations in time where the permeability is fixed but electrical conductivity can be highly discontinuous. The goal of the inversion is to recover the conductivitygiven measurements of the electric and/or magnetic fields. The availability of matrix-factorization software and highperformance computing has allowed us to solve the 3D time domain EM problem using direct solvers. This is particularly advantageous when data from many transmitters and over many decades are available. We first formulate Maxwell’s equations in terms of the magnetic field, H{\textasciitilde} . The problem is then discretized using a finite volume technique in space and backward Euler in time. The forward operator is symmetric positive definite and a Cholesky decomposition can be performed with the work distributed over an array of processors. The forward modeling is quickly carried out using the factored operator. Time savings are considerable and they make 3D inversion of large ground or airborne data sets feasible. This is illustrated by using synthetic examples and by inverting a multisource UTEM field data set acquired at San Nicolás, which is a massive sulfide deposit in Mexico.},

. Although a recent decrease has occurred in the number of surveys and publications associated with this technique, the method has become firmly established as an important geophysical tool in the offshore environment. This is a consequence of two important aspects associated with the physics of the method: First, it is sensitive to high electrical resistivity, which, although not an unambiguous indicator of hydrocarbons, is an important property of economically viable reservoirs. Second, although the method lacks the resolution of seismic wave propagation, it has a much better intrinsic resolution than potential-field methods such as gravity and magnetic surveying, which until now have been the primary nonseismic data sets used in offshore exploration. Although by many measures marine CSEM is still in its infancy, the reliability and noise floors of the instrument systems have improved significantly over the last decade, and interpretation methodology has progressed from simple anomaly detection to 3D anisotropic inversion of multicomponent data using some of the world’s fastest supercomputers. Research directions presently include tackling the airwave problem in shallow water by applying time-domain methodology, continuous profiling tools, and the use of CSEM for reservoir monitoring during production.},

	abstract = {Buried tunnel valleys are common features in formerly glaciated areas, and where present, they are very important for the groundwater recharge and flow. Delineation of the structures and modelling of the infill is therefore very important in relation to groundwater mapping. Typically, borehole information is too sparse to enable a detailed delineation of the structures, whereas densely covering airborne electromagnetic data have proven to be very useful for this. In the last decades, the mapping approach has been studied carefully, but the 3D modelling of the valley structures has not been described to the same degree yet. In this study, we create a 3D geological model of an area that is characterised by a complex network of buried valleys mapped with a spatially dense airborne electromagnetic survey. Due to the comprehensive dataset, the modelling requires formulation of an advanced strategy. This contains a number of steps, where the AEM-derived resistivity data are initially interpreted based on the geological background knowledge to identify the buried valleys and build a conceptual geological model. Secondly, the age relationships between the valleys are established from the valley orientations and their internal cross-cut relationships. Thirdly, the deep erosional surfaces are modelled. Subsequently, the interpreted age relationships are utilised to trim the valley floor surfaces, such that younger valleys cut older. Finally, a voxel model is built and populated with lithofacies and stratigraphical units. The model is constructed as a combined layer-based and voxel model in order to map both the overall structures as well as the lithological variations within the 3D model domain. The final model contains 20 buried valleys that show a complex cross-cut setting that indicate the presence of at least eight valley generations. Most of the valley infills show lithological variations, and the final voxel model thus contains 42 different geological units.},

	abstract = {We develop three methods to invert induced polarization (IP) data. The foundation for our algorithms is an assumption that the ultimate effect of chargeability is to alter the effective conductivity when current is applied. This assumption, which was first put forth by Siegel and has been routinely adopted in the literature, permits the IP responses to be numerically modeled by carrying out two forward modelings using a DC resistivity algorithm. The intimate connection between DC and IP data means that inversion of IP data is a two‐step process. First, the DC potentials are inverted to recover a background conductivity. The distribution of chargeability can then be found by using any one of the three following techniques: (1) linearizing the IP data equation and solving a linear inverse problem, (2) manipulating the conductivities obtained after performing two DC resistivity inversions, and (3) solving a nonlinear inverse problem. Our procedure for performing the inversion is to divide the earth into rectangular prisms and to assume that the conductivity σ and chargeability η are constant in each cell. To emulate complicated earth structure we allow many cells, usually far more than there are data. The inverse problem, which has many solutions, is then solved as a problem in optimization theory. A model objective function is designed, and a “model” (either the distribution of σ or η)is sought that minimizes the objective function subject to adequately fitting the data. Generalized subspace methodologies are used to solve both inverse problems, and positivity constraints are included. The IP inversion procedures we design are generic and can be applied to 1-D, 2-D, or 3-D earth models and with any configuration of current and potential electrodes. We illustrate our methods by inverting synthetic DC/IP data taken over a 2-D earth structure and by inverting dipole‐dipole data taken in Quebec.},

The bottleneck in frequency- and time-domain calculations of electromagnetic responses derived in the wavenumber-frequency domain is the transformations from the wavenumber to the space domain and from the frequency to the time domain, the so-called Hankel and Fourier transforms. Three different Hankel transform methods (quadrature, quadrature-with-extrapolation [QWE], and filters) and four different Fourier transform methods (fast Fourier transform [FFT], FFTLog, QWE, and filters) are included in empymod, which allows us to compare these different methods in terms of speed and precision. The best transform in terms of speed and precision depends on the modeled frequencies. Published digital filters for the Hankel transform are very fast and precise for frequencies in the range of controlled-source electromagnetic data, but they fail in the frequency range of ground-penetrating radar. Conventional quadrature, on the other hand, is in comparison very slow but can model any frequency. Examples comparing empymod with analytical solutions and with existing electromagnetic modelers illustrate the capabilities of empymod.},

In some surveys, well-casings have been used as “extended electrodes” for near surface environmental or geotechnical applications. Wells are often cased with steel, which has both a high conductivity and a significant magnetic permeability. The large physical property contrasts as well as the large disparity in length-scales, which are introduced when a steel-cased well is in a modeling domain, makes performing an electromagnetic forward simulation challenging. Using this setting as motivation, we present a finite volume approach for modeling electromagnetic problems on cylindrically symmetric and 3D cylindrical meshes which include an azimuthal discretization. The associated software implementation includes modeling capabilities for direct current resistivity, time domain electromagnetics, and frequency domain electromagnetics for models that include variable electrical conductivity and magnetic permeability. Electric and magnetic fields, fluxes, and charges are readily accessible in any simulation so that they can be visualized and interrogated. We demonstrate the value of being able to explore the behavior of electromagnetic fields and fluxes through examples which revisit a number of foundational papers on direct current resistivity and electromagnetics in steel-cased wells. The software implementation is open source and included as a part of the SimPEG software ecosystem for simulation and parameter estimation in geophysics.},
